A simple web application built using **Gin** framework in Go. This app demonstrates a basic user registration and login system with JWT authentication. It connects to a PostgreSQL database and uses GORM for ORM-based database interactions.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Register new users with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Log in with credentials and receive a JWT token.
- **JWT Authentication**: The app uses JWT for authentication to secure endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: The app uses PostgreSQL as the backend database with GORM as the ORM.

## Technologies

- **Go**: Programming language used to build the backend.
- **Gin**: Web framework for building REST APIs in Go.
- **GORM**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for storing user data.
